### Project

#### 0. Security Issues in Smart Contracts on Emerging Blockchain Platforms

- Lab for Internet and Security Technology (LIST) of Zhejiang University
- August 2018 - Present
- Use static techniques such as backward dataflow analysis and symbolic execution to analyze smart contracts on emerging blockchain platforms (Ethereum, EOS, etc.) to find integer overflows.
- Automatically generate exploits to validate vulnerabilities.
- Compile smart contracts (written in different languages) on different platforms into the LLVM IR to support unified static analysis, thus implementing a scalable vulnerability detection system.

#### 1. Measurement Study of Android In-app Advertisements

- Lab for Internet and Security Technology (LIST) of Zhejiang University
- September 2016 - August 2018
- Develop a static analysis framework for Android apps, conduct a large-scale measurement study on mobile ads in Android apps, and provide practical guidance for developers on how to maximize revenue by embedding third-party ad libraries.
- Based on UI and interactive behaviors, propose a methodology of ad type classification, which classifies mobile ads into five types: embedded, popup, notification, offerwall, and floating.
- Static analysis at API granularity: Scan the smali codes of Android apps to find the APIs of third-party ad libraries. Then, map the APIs to specific ad types.
- Statistically analyze ad types, ad mediation and the number of ad libraries embedded in Android apps, and provide guidance for developers on how to integrate third-party ad libraries to maximize revenue.

#### 2. OSN Spam Detection (Summer Camp)

- Lab for Internet and Security Technology (LIST) of Zhejiang University
- July 2015 - August 2015
- Develop a spam detection system based on template matching, which can be used for WeChat, a Chinese online social network (OSN).
- Use existing spam detection tools to collect a spam dataset in OSN on a large scale.
- Use the jieba tool to split each message text into an ordered set of words and mark their attributes (such as nouns, verbs, etc.). That is, each message corresponds to an ordered set.
- Perform cluster analysis on all ordered sets in the dataset, and extract frequently occurring invariant strings to generate templates. Meanwhile, use ".*" to match any character between invariant strings.
- With the generated templates, use REGEXP to match message texts, and report whether they are spams.

#### 3. On-chip Optical Network (National College Students Innovation Experiment Program)

- Advanced Networking Technology Lab of Xidian University
- June 2015 - June 2016
- Advisor: Prof. [Huaxi Gu](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/hxgu/en/index.html)
- Develop a simulator for physical analysis of multicast optical network (based on C++ in OMNET++ IDE)
